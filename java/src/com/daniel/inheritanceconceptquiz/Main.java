//        1. Write a Java program to create a class called Animal with a method
//        called makeSound(). Create a subclass called Cat that overrides
//        the makeSound() method to bark.
//          Cat cat1 = new Cat();
//          cat1.makeSound();



//        2. Write a Java program to create a class called Vehicle with a
//        method called drive(). Create a subclass called Car that
//        overrides the drive() method to print "Repairing a car".
//        Car car1 = new Car();
//        car1.drive();


//        3. Write a Java program to create a class called Shape with a method
//        called getArea(). Create a subclass called Rectangle that overrides the
//        getArea() method to calculate the area of a rectangle.
//          Rectangle rectangle1 = new Rectangle(10,90);
//          System.out.println(rectangle1.getArea());


//        4. Write a Java program to create a class called Employee with methods
//        called work() and getSalary(). Create a subclass called HRManager
//        that overrides the work() method and adds a new method called addEmployee().
//        HRManager hr1 = new HRManager();
//        hr1.addEmployee();
//        hr1.work();


//        5. Write a Java program to create a class known as "BankAccount" with
//        methods called deposit() and withdraw(). Create a subclass called SavingsAccount
//        that overrides the withdraw() method to prevent withdrawals if the account balance
//        falls below one hundred.
//          BankAccount b1 = new BankAccount("1001", 500);
//          SavingsAccount s1 = new SavingsAccount("1001", 500.00);
//          s1.deposit(5000);
//          s1.withdraw(5400);
//          s1.displayBalance();



//        6. Write a Java program to create a class called Animal with a method named move().
//        Create a subclass called Cheetah that overrides the move() method to run.
//        Cheetah c1 = new Cheetah();
//        c1.move();

//        7. Write a Java program to create a class known as Person with methods
//        called getFirstName() and getLastName(). Create a subclass called Employee
//        that adds a new method named getEmployeeId() and overrides the getLastName()
//        method to include the employee's job title.
//        Person p1 = new Person("Daniel", "Olasupo");
//        System.out.println("First Name: " + p1.getFirstName());
//        System.out.println("Last Name: " + p1.getLastName());
//
//        Employeee e1 = new Employeee("Judah", "Olasupo", "FHA01");
//        System.out.println("First Name: " + e1.getFirstName());
//        System.out.println("Last Name: " + e1.getLastName());
//        System.out.println("Employee ID: " + e1.getEmployeeId());


//        8. Write a Java program to create a class called Shape with methods called
//        getPerimeter() and getArea(). Create a subclass called Circle that overrides the
//        getPerimeter() and getArea() methods to calculate the area and perimeter of a
//        circle.


//        9. Write a Java program to create a vehicle class hierarchy. The base class should
//        be Vehicle, with subclasses Truck, Car and Motorcycle. Each subclass should have
//        properties such as make, model, year, and fuel type. Implement methods for
//        calculating fuel efficiency, distance traveled, and maximum speed.
